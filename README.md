# Rusty Project Template
A Template Project for Nextjs Based Hobby Projects. This is a very opinionated template, the idea is that it will give you everything you need to start with to create and design UIs, with the idea that a good portion of your computions will happen on Firebase. Just clone or Copy the repo, do some simple changes then get right into your project.
